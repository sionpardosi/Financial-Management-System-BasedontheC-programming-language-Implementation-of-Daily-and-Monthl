Welcome to the C-Based Financial Management System repository! This project aims to develop a simple application using the C programming language to manage daily and monthly expenses. The application is designed to allow users to record their daily expenditures and analyze their total monthly expenses.

## Key Features

### 1. Daily Expense Input
   - Users can input their expenditure for specific dates.
   - Each date has a variable representing the expenditure amount, as specified in the provided code.

### 2. Daily Financial Data
   - Users can view detailed expenditure information based on specific dates.
   - Each date has a variable storing the daily expenditure amount, as demonstrated in the implementation for the month of February.

### 3. Monthly Financial Data
   - Users can view the total monthly expenditure by entering the desired year and month.
   - The application will calculate the total expenditure for that month based on the variables representing daily expenses.

## How to Use

### 1. Setup
   - Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC.
   - Clone this repository into your local directory.

### 2. Running the Application
   - Compile the program using the command `gcc file_name.c -o output_name` in the terminal.
   - Run the application by executing the generated output file (`./output_name`).

### 3. Interacting with the Application
   - Select options from the main menu to input expenses, view daily financial data, or view monthly financial data.
   - The user will be prompted for input according to the instructions displayed on the screen.

## Customization and Further Development
